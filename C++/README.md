This is the C++ implementation of the code to be translated and implemented into Golang
======

### Note:

This repo will be utilised in initally to create prototypes of implementations that will be tampered with in the future.

This is only experimental and for developmental purposes, but the final code and final implemantation will utilise Golang due to its massive advantages within the syntax, readability and webdevelopment aspects.

I at this moment am more confident with C++, however, and will slowly enhance my Go skills in order to create more prototypes at a faster rate.

#### Test:

This program creates two a ramdomly generated alphanumeric strings and concatenate them together.

These strings are then stored in a map which I am currently utiliseing  as the database aspect of the project. 

The strings are generated based upon user input. If the user is to enter any number (except 0 and 1), a new item is created.
If the user enters a boolena value, the program terminates and displays the current items in its map.
